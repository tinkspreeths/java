/*lets say sorting there are many sorting bubble,insertion ....as a user you shld nt worry abt 
those sorting implementations ,is called as abstraction.class name def shld be abstract but
not in methods "there shld be def an abstract named methd"like that.
there cannot be creation of obj for a abs class and a method only concrete class and methd can 
create obj
abs opposite is concrete evrythg is present here.
abs need not to be 100% abs if we do not want that class "object creation*,directly,thn we can use this abs/
