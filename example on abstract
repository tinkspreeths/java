//super class there the mentioned method is present and so compiler will finish its task 
//it will not hand over to the runtime so,method of super class will be displayed .
//its better to have a abs and concrete mthd ok,in super class con mthd is common for all sub class which will goes to the all the subclasses.thats why!!!
