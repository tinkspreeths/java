/*in arrays,we can have reference variable of the objects also referring to some other objects
 but all should be in same class infact 
array is an object so int[] j;means ref j created till now not pointing to any object.:) 
to point to an object we need to create it know like int []i=new int[5];now obj of 5 elements
are created i is referring to those objects.object array having one predefined variable called
length which will return its size.//the objects values will be 0 by default.an array of 
references to objects of type String is a class
