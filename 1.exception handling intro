basically,u will get error if u done any mistake while typing program either it may be syntatical error or some compile time error which is
directedly reported by the compiler to you,if any run time error then,it will stop i java,for handling those errors we use concept exception
handling.for each and every error jvm will try to create an object for it and we have to write the code for it using that object.it will not
stop executing the flow of program if you handle it properly.


types of exceptions
checked-if we can itself able to judge that this particular line of code going to give us an error,then compiler will force us to handle
it .either using try catch block or using throws.which compiler will force us.
unchecked-here compiler will not force us to handle ,eg:-arrayindexoutofbounds exception ,arithmatic exception
